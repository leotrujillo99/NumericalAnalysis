% If you are in the habit of using the 'Run' button in matlab (I think it is
% still a big green triangle), try to get out of the habit.  If you are new
% to Matlab, please just forget that button exists.  Instead, go into the
% command window and run your programs from there (as above).

% This will test your matmult routine.  myeps should be about 10^-16, and 
% err1,... ,err4 should be 0 or very close to zero (not be much larger
% than macheps).
%
% err5 tests your error checking for matrix sizes.
